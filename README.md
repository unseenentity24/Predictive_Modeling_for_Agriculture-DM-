ðŸŒ¾ Predictive_Modeling_for_Agriculture

This project leverages machine learning to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection based on soil nutrient levels. By analysing key soil parameters, the model aims to recommend the most suitable crop, optimising yield and resource utilisation.
ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset, soil_measures.csv, comprises:
	â€¢	N: Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
	â€¢	P: Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
	â€¢	K: Potassium content ratio in the soil
	â€¢	pH: pH value of the soil
	â€¢	crop: Target variable indicating the optimal crop type
